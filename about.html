                    H-Thai-Ml started out as a food truck catering to the first friday crowd
                    in historic Downtown Las Vegas. After a successful festival run the owner
                    launched his first location in Henderson Nevada on the aptly named HTML
                    lane. Aaron always had a passion for coding, but many didn't know he had
                    a flare for cuisine. Inspired by his 6 month stay in Thailand, aaron ventured
                    into the unknown, creating Vegas' first Southwestern Thai Fusion spot. And thus 
                    H-Thai-ML was born!
